# Dotfiles  

This repository contains my dotfiles and other configuration files. They control everything from shell behavior to application preferences and system settings. I plan to update them regularly. 

The goal is to ensure that when I need to set up a new personal Mac, I won't have to reconfigure everything.

Although these files may not be useful for most people, I decided to make the repository public so others can learn from them. I have learned a lot by examining other people's dotfiles. Of course, these files do not contain API keys or other sensitive environment variables.
